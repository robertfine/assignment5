<p>My experience is in music production. I started writing short scores for short films that were never made. Then, at the start of high school, I began making beats for my friends who started rapping. By my senior year, I was making beats, working on an album, and scoring my friends short films.</p> 

<p>A films most valuable tool is its music. Emotion is carried through a multitude of different mediums but sound and music are some of the most accessible. In short, upgrade your short film to a short masterpiece!</p>
